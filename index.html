		<p>On Friday, Harlem residents coming home from work were upset exiting the train station because drug activity is the norm surrounding 125th and 116th street. Unfortunately, Harlem has the most drug clinics in New York, and residents in Harlem want a change in their community because Harlem is a low-income community compared to districts like Noho.  
 </p>

			<p>Yvette Green, an East Harlem resident and a Greater Harlem Coalition member mentions that if you go to 125th street, it is a major drug quarter. She says there are drug addicts, drug users, and drug dealers hanging around because Harlem is oversaturated with drug clinics. She added that the only way to get rid of the drug users' is to get rid of the available programs.
</p>
			
			<p>"You don't see 20 pharmacies on the same block. You don't see three or four critical hospitals right next to each other," said Green." It's not normal. Harlem and East Harlem have a history of these programs getting dumped on each of us."
</p>
			
			<p>She also states that Harlem could not get the coalition needed to fight against drug clinics which will cause  Harlem to continue to be dumped with drug clinics persistently. Green says her community has drastically changed over the years since she has lived in Harlem. 
 </p>
			
			<p>"When they put the safe injection site on 124th street, it was a terrible downhill spiral," said Green. "It was ten times worse".
